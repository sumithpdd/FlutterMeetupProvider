Demo
----
Create an app with 
1. flutter create todo_flutter
2. cd .\todo_flutter\
3. code .
This is a working version of the layout.
So just show how its layed out and built

main.dart -> is a Materialapp -> TasksScreen

In the 'screens' folder -> TasksScreen which is a stateless widget
it returns a Scaffold -> notice CircleAvatar -> also notice color: Theme.of(context).accentColor
Notice the other container => boxDecoration and we enclosed he container in an Expanded widget to take it all the avilable spacce

'widgets' folder - Task List and Task Tile -> widgets from existing widgets List View and ListTile

Look at the FloatingActionButton thats has the add buttton -> showModalBottomSheet

In the AddTaskScreen we can see textfield, Addbutton and the BoxDecoration for container

4. Flutter run


/////////////
StateManagement

TaskCheckBox as StatefulWidget as it has to react to user input and change its state. -> Local State

lass TaskCheckBox extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _TaskCheckBoxState createState() => _TaskCheckBoxState();
}

class _TaskCheckBoxState extends State<TaskCheckBox> {
  bool isChecked;
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Checkbox(
      activeColor: Theme.of(context).accentColor,
      value: isChecked,
      onChanged: (bool newValue) {
        setState(() {
           isChecked = newValue;       
        });
      },
    );
  }

but we need to manage it through out the app ->


Now we make the app more dynamic,
'models' Folder
use ListView.builder as its performant and can expand on demand.
Check the checkboxCallback ->  //Callback
